When we tested our LOC we got ~2000 lines of OCaml. We do have some places 
such as in printing and testing where we use a large number of lines to hold 
data. We understand that this shouldn't count towards out total lines of code.
That said we tested without these lines and still had above 1500 lines.

We believe that for the sake of code simplicity leaving this text in our files
makes understanding the code base easier.
